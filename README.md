**Workshop Overview**
**Title:** Bolstering Democratic Resilience through OSINT: Informing Responses to Chinese Strategic Competition in the 4th Industrial Revolution with Open Source Tools

**Abstract:** This workshop is designed to leverage Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) for understanding and responding to Chinese strategic competition within the techno-economic landscape of the 4th Industrial Revolution. It aims to shift focus from traditional project-centric discussions to a systems thinking approach, dissecting policy tensions and establishing clear objectives to counter strategies that undermine democratic values. The workshop will provide practical OSINT guidelines, targeting technologies such as undersea cables, AI, biotechnology, and quantum computing.
